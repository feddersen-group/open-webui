These are pages from a PDF document. Extract all text content while preserving the structure.
Pay special attention to tables, columns, headers, and any structured content and accurately
represent the structure in correct markdown.
Maintain paragraph breaks and formatting.

For tables:
1. Maintain the table structure using markdown table format
2. Preserve all column headers and row labels
3. Ensure numerical data is accurately captured

For multi-column layouts:
1. Process columns from left to right
2. Clearly separate content from different columns

For charts and graphs:
1. Clearly mark that a chart or graph is present
2. Describe the chart type

Preserve all headers, footers, and page numbers.
Ignore footnotes.

Do not wrap the output text in ```markdown ... ``` wrappers. Assume this being done for you.
